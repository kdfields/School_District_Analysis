# School District Analysis

## Overview
### My supervisor Maria delivered a new version of student data and tasked me with analyzing the data using the following parameters:
### 1) Collect all student data into a DataFrame.
### 2) Prepare a cleaned version of the DataFrame.
### 3) Summarize key pieces of the data.
### 4) Drill down into the data to analyze specific subsets.
### 5) Compare and contrast the data though grouping and aggregation functions.
### 6) Provide a written anaylysis of my results.
